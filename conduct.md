PyDiff activities are governed by a formal code of conduct. In short, participants at PyDiff events
are expected to contribute to an environment that is **open** and welcoming, **considerate** and
**respectful**.

A fuller statement of these values is given in the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
